Carole's a recent widow. She used to have John, her late husband fold her money. She doesn't mind using debit and credit, but those don't help when you want to buy the grand kids ice cream.

She looked at solutions. She hates asking people to fold her money and she hates using smart phones and their apps. Existing producls like iBill cost too much for solving a simple problem.
